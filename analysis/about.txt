Cones turn into crescent (barchan) dunes.

Exploration of parameter space to see effect of sintering rate, lambda_S, and wind strength parameter Tau_min on the shapes of the dunes.

These files all overwrote each other on the same genesis DUN.csp, and may have initial conditions that do not match their parameter files. Filenames have been corrected to match cone/layer shape. Other errors not impossible, though they should be restricted to the initial
configuration and not mar the parameters.
